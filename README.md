# My Personal Website

I have given myself a personal goal to launch two personal projects this semester, with the first one being this website, and the other to hopefully be some form of a mobile app (hopefully not too ambitious).

So far, I have been practicing and getting better at HTML and CSS, and have partially initialized the beginning pieces of my website.

I am currently in the process of learning javascript and typescript, which I hope to implement on my website in the future. 

I also need to learn on how to create a public domain, and utilize webkit and other tools to properly launch the website.

Slowly but surely making progress!
